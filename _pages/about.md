Hi, there! I'm Zhe Wang, a first year MS (Master of Science in Computer Science) student from Siebel School of Computing and Data Science, University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign.   I am advised by Prof. [Lingming Zhang](https://lingming.cs.illinois.edu).

My research interest includes natural language processing (NLP), software engineering (SE) and machine learning (ML).

You can find my CV here: [Zhe's CV](https://zhewang2001.github.io/assets/Zhe_s_CV_github.pdf)
