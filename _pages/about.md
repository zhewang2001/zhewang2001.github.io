Hi, there! I'm Zhe Wang, a first year MS (Master of Science in Computer Science) student from Siebel School of Computing and Data Science, University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign.   I am advised by Prof. [Lingming Zhang](https://lingming.cs.illinois.edu)
My research interest includes natural language processing (NLP), software engineering (SE) and machine learning (ML).


# üíª Research Interests 

- **Transfer Learning:** to have a more fundamental understanding of the behavior of large language models (LLMs), enabling their effective adaptation to knowledge-intensive and everyday scenarios.

- **AI for Code:** to build and evaluate AI programmers to propel developer efficiency and improve software quality.



# üìù Publications 


[Magicoder: Source Code Is All You Need](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.02120)
